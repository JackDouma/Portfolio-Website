                    <h3>Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a fourth year Lakehead University student pursuing a degree in Honours Bachelor in Computer Science. Additionally, I have a computer programming degree at Georgian College.
                        I have experience working on a number of different large scale projects, including software, website,
                        and mobile development working in a team and working individually. I have knowledge in almost all the most commonly used languages we use today, 
                        such as C#, C++, Java, and Python, and have strong knowledge in databases using SQL, JSON, and XML. 
                        I also have knowledge in different methods of building websites, such as ASP.NET, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap, and CSS. A full list can be viewed <a href="expertise.html">Here</a>.
                        I am looking for full time co-op opportunities starting in summer 2025, and part time opportunities during the school year.<br><br>
                        In addition to these technical abilities, I am capable of being organized and efficient in completing tasks independently, 
                        I have strong communication, written, and verbal skills, and Iâ€™m also very reliable and dependable in completing tasks on time.<br><br>
                        I am ready to take on a new challenge and put what I have learned to the test at an organization. 
                        I look forward to learning new skills and getting valuable working experience in the industry.

                    <p>
                        I have been playing Hockey for 15 years mostly as a goaltender. I use to play rep hockey, and currently play for my school team.<br><br>
                        I am also the team manager for the Esports club at the school, the Georgian CyberGrizzlies, where I am in charge of all the teams that play for the school.
                        I am responsible for scheduling scrimmages, running tryouts, coordinating with the marketing team, and helping the players in any other way.<br><br>
                        I have also been a tester at <a href="https://x.com/MCChampionship_" target="_blank">MC Championship</a> for 5 years, where we play test, look for bugs, and give feedback on games
                        that popular influencer will play and broadcast in official events.
